# API_Profit_With-OneAPI
This code loads revenue data from a CSV file, calculates the average price per transaction, and outputs it. It then suggests optimizing costs, focusing on user retention, monitoring performance metrics, experimenting with pricing models, and seeking partnerships as strategies to improve profit optimization for an API. Finally, it visualizes the revenue data using a line plot.
The ML Model loads a revenue dataset and trains a linear regression model to predict revenue based on price. It then predicts revenue for a range of prices and finds the price that maximizes revenue.
